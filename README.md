# Oxyde

## About

Oxyde is a small multithreaded web server written in Turbo Pascal. 

## Compilation and launching

Use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) to compile Oxyde.

By default, Oxyde executable file is compiled in `\run` folder. 
Compilation needs `\build` folder for compiler-generated files (Lazarus asks you to create it if necessary).

Change options in configuration file (`\run\conf\server.conf`) and launch Oxyde comand line interpreter. You can test it in your favorite browser ([http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) by default).
